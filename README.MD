# Random Word List Creator
## Random Unordered Word List from Dictionary

This script creates a list of random unordered words to test on search/sort algorithms (i.e. quick sort, bubble sort, jump search etc). 

It will create an unordered word list, from an existing 466k words dictionary, which can be ordered, and will create a query list which can be used on the previous list.

Reads dictionary from and writes both lists to your Desktop directory.
